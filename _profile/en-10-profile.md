description: "I am an environmental engineer. My interest has always been at the environment, quality, safety for the workers and the environment.
  I've planned my curriculum, and then my career choices, in order to develop my attitude towards innovation and knowledge in order to pursue my interests and therefore do a job that allows me to use what I've learnt to help in the field of safety and let workers have better working conditions."
